# Caesar Cipher

A simple Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.

---

## 
What is it?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It shifts each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of **3**:  
- **A → D**, **B → E**, **C → F**, etc.

---

##  Features

- Encrypt any text by shifting letters forward.
- Decrypt text by shifting letters backward.
- Supports both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters.
- Keeps spaces and punctuation unchanged.
- Simple terminal/console input.

---

##  How to Run

1. **Save the code**

   Save the Python script as `caesar_cipher.py`.

2. **Install Python**

   Make sure Python is installed. Check with:
   ```bash
   python --version


## Example Output
Encrypt or Decrypt? (E/D): E
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter shift value (integer): 3
Result: The encrypted message is → Khoor Zruog
